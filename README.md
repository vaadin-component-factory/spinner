# Spinner

Simple Java API for Lumo Spinner.

## Development instructions

### Important Files 

* Spinner.java: The Java component file using vcf-spinner web component.

* src/main/resources/META-INF/resources/frontend/src/vcf-spinner.ts: The web component of the Spinner defining vcf-spinner web component.

* TestView.java: A View class that let's you test the component you are building. This and other classes in the test folder will not be packaged during the build. You can add more test view classes in this package.
* assembly/: this folder includes configuration for packaging the project into a JAR so that it works well with other Vaadin projects and the Vaadin Directory. There is usually no need to modify these files, unless you need to add JAR manifest entries.

If you are using static resources such as images, JS (e.g. templates) and CSS files the correct location for them is under the `/src/main/resources/META-INF/resources/frontend` directory and is described here [Resource Cheat Sheet](https://vaadin.com/docs/v14/flow/importing-dependencies/tutorial-ways-of-importing.html#resource-cheat-sheet)in more details. 

### Deployment

Starting the test/demo server:
```
mvn jetty:run
```

This deploys demo at http://localhost:8080

### Branching information

* `master` the latest version of the starter, using latest stable platform version

## Publishing to Vaadin Directory

You can create the zip package needed for [Vaadin Directory](https://vaadin.com/directory/) using

```
mvn versions:set -DnewVersion=1.0.0 # You cannot publish snapshot versions 
mvn install -Pdirectory
```

The package is created as `target/spinner-24.0.0.zip`
